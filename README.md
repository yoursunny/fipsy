# Fipsy FPGA code

[Fipsy FPGA Breakout Board](https://www.mocomakers.com/fipsy-fpga/) is an introductory FPGA board that integrates a Lattice MachXO2-256 field-programmable gate array.
This repository collects my Verilog code for Fipsy board.

## Available Designs

[empty](empty): cleaned up baseline that does nothing.

[5led](5led): blink five LEDs.

[piano4](piano4): piano using a 4-key button module and a passive buzzer.

[rot13](rot13): ROT13 transformation over UART.

[sakura](sakura): play music with two passive buzzers.

[neopixel18](neopixel18): display colors on a NeoPixel ring.
