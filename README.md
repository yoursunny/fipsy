# Fipsy FPGA code

[Fipsy FPGA Breakout Board](https://www.mocomakers.com/fipsy-fpga/) is an introductory FPGA board that integrates a Lattice MachXO2-256 field-programmable gate array.
This repository collects my Verilog code for Fipsy board.

My code is released to public domain under 0BSD license.
However, code incorporated from elsewhere may be under different licenses, as noted in comments.
